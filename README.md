# systelab-components

Library with common UI components to speed up your Angular developments. You can take a look to the components in our showcase at https://systelab.github.io/components. Read the documentation at https://github.com/systelab/systelab-components/tree/master/src/app/systelab-components

## Working with the repo

In order to clone the repository and test the library use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/systelab/systelab-components.git
cd systelab-components
npm install
ng serve (or npm run ng serve)
```

This will bootstrap a showcase application to test the different components.

## Test
For testing purposes, the strategy chosen is Snapshot Testing.

Snapshot tests are a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI does not change unexpectedly.

A typical snapshot test case for a mobile app renders a UI component, takes a screenshot, then compares it to a reference image stored alongside the test. The test will fail if the two images do not match: either the change is unexpected, or the screenshot needs to be updated to the new version of the UI component.

In order to run the test, run the command:

```bash
ng e2e
```

If you want to update the snapshots, run the command:

```bash
npm run update-snapshots
```

## Publish the Library

In order to publish the library, an authorized npm user is required. Once set, update the version in the package.json, and run the npm publish script:

```bash
npm publish
```

Be careful because temporary folders will be created (build, css, html, widgets,...) and this files should be untracked as it is specified in the gitignore file.
