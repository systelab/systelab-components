# Overview

Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. They communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

## When to use

Use buttons to communicate actions users can take and to allow users to interact with the page. Each page should have one primary button, and any remaining calls to action should be represented as lower emphasis buttons.

## When not to use

Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.

## Button variants

| Variant   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary   | For the principal call to action on the page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen (not including the application header, modal dialog, or side panel).                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Secondary | For secondary actions on each page. Secondary buttons can only be used in conjunction with a primary button. As part of a pair, the secondary button’s function is to perform the negative action of the set, such as “Cancel” or “Back”. Do not use a secondary button in isolation and do not use a secondary button for a positive action. |
| Tertiary  | For less prominent, and sometimes independent, actions. Tertiary buttons can be used in isolation or paired with a primary button when there are multiple calls to action. Tertiary buttons can also be used for sub-tasks on a page where a primary button for the main and final action is present.                                         |
| Danger    | For actions that could have destructive effects on the user’s data (for example, delete or remove). Danger button has three styles: primary, tertiary, and ghost.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Link      | For the least pronounced actions; often used in conjunction with a primary button. In a situation such as a progress flow, a ghost button may be paired with a primary and secondary button set, where the primary button is for forward action, the secondary button is for “Back”, and the ghost button is for “Cancel”.                    |

# Formatting

## Anatomy

A button’s text label is the most important element on a button, as it communicates the action that will be performed when the user interacts with it. In a contained button the text is always left-aligned, not centered.

If a text label is not used, an icon should be present to signify what the button does.
