# Contributing to an Angular library

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Angular libraries, which are hosted in [Werfen](https://github.com/systelab) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for an Angular library. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue on the repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](https://github.com/systelab/systelab-components/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started with the library, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started it otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of library which the suggestion is related to.
* **If you're reporting it crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an enhancement on the repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](https://github.com/systelab/systelab-components/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of library which the suggestion is related to.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain library's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible library
- Enable a sustainable system for library's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. This repository is aligned with the feature-branch strategy. The branch naming convention is "bugfix- or feature-" plus the issue number in github. For example: bugfix_200
2. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
3. The changes can be tested in your local before publishing. The library can be generated at "..\dist\systelab-components" by running the command "npm run build-lib". Then, you need to replace the systelab-components folder at "your project > node-modules > systelab-components". Please, ensure the package.json matches the version that you need to test.
4. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>
5. While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
7. Before merging the pull request, the master branch needs to be merged into current. Then, the version in the package.json needs to be increased.
6. Once it's merged, the author must transition it to the status "Ready to test" in the [project](https://github.com/systelab/systelab-components/projects)
7. Based upon need, the library will be published into the npm repository. This process must be done by an authorized user.
