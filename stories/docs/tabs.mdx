# Overview

Tabs are used to quickly navigate between views within the same context.

# Formatting

## Tab label

Each tab label describes the content contained within it. Labels are concise and use no more than two words. Keep in mind that at mobile widths and during translation, the character length of a label will impact the experience. Do not use icons in tab labels.

## Number of tabs

In most scenarios, you should use no more than six tabs. This maintains an uncluttered UI and reduces cognitive load for users. If more than six tabs are needed, consider other navigation patterns, such as a side-nav.

## Order

Tab order should be consistent across an experience. Tabs with related content should be grouped adjacent to each other.
